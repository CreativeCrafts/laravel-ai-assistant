// You can ask a follow up question
$chat = AiAssistant::acceptPrompt('did she win any award for her work?')->andRespond();

//response
[
  "role" => "assistant"
  "content" => "No, Jane Austen did not win any awards during her lifetime as literary awards did not exist in the way they do today.

"""
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of technology that is revolutionizing the way we interact with the world around us. From self-driving cars to voice-activated home assistants, AI is making our lives easier and more efficient. But what exactly is AI, and how is it changing our lives?
AI is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can think and act like humans. AI systems are designed to learn from their environment and make decisions based on what they learn. This means that AI can be used to automate tasks, such as recognizing faces or driving cars, and can even be used to create new products and services.
AI is already being used in a variety of industries, from healthcare to finance. In healthcare, AI is being used to diagnose diseases and provide personalized treatments. In finance, AI is being used to detect fraud and improve customer service. AI is also being used in retail to create personalized shopping experiences and in manufacturing to automate tasks and increase efficiency.
AI is also being used to improve our lives in more subtle ways. For example, AI can be used to create virtual assistants that can help us with everyday tasks, such as scheduling appointments or ordering groceries. AI can also be used to create more efficient search engines and to improve the accuracy of online translations.
AI is an exciting and rapidly evolving field of technology that is changing the way we interact with the world around us. As AI continues to develop, it will open up new possibilities for how we live our lives and interact with each other.

## Important Update

This fork includes critical updates to address compatibility issues with the latest OpenAI API changes. The main modifications are:

1. Replaced the deprecated `/v1/edits` endpoint with the chat completion endpoint in the `TextEditCompletion` class.
2. Updated the configuration to use the chat model for text editing tasks.

### Changes in Detail

#### TextEditCompletion.php

The `TextEditCompletion` class has been modified to use the chat completion endpoint instead of the deprecated edits endpoint. This change ensures compatibility with the current OpenAI API.

#### Configuration

The `ai-assistant.php` configuration file now includes a new `chat_model` option.

### Cmpatibility

This fork is compatible with OpenAI API as of August 2024. It uses the gpt-3.5-turbo model by default, but you can specify gpt-4 or other available models in your configuration if you have access to them.

## Add to .env

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
