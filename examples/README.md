### 07. Image Generation (`07-image-generation.php`)

**Purpose**: Generate, edit, and create variations of images.

**What you'll learn**:
- Generating images from prompts with `image(['prompt' => ...])`

### 08. Unified API (`08-unified-api.php`)

**Purpose**: Demonstrate the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) unified API approach.

**What you'll learn**:
- Using one interface for all operations (text, audio, image)
- How the API automatically routes to appropriate endpoints
- Building multi-step AI workflows
- Combining different AI capabilities seamlessly
- Benefits of the unified API design
- Consistent error handling across all operations

**Time**: ~3 minutes

**Example output**:
```
=== Unified API Example ===

1. Text Conversation -> Routes to Response API
2. Audio Transcription -> Routes to Audio API
3. Text-to-Speech -> Routes to Audio Speech API
4. Image Generation -> Routes to Image API

Multi-Step Workflow:
  Step 1: Generated tagline
  Step 2: Audio saved to output/
  Step 3: Image saved to output/
```

**Note**: This example showcases the SSOT architecture where a single API intelligently delegates to different OpenAI endpoints based on input type.

## Integration into Your Application

These examples use standalone scripts for simplicity. To integrate into your Laravel application:

### In Controllers

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use CreativeCrafts\LaravelAiAssistant\Facades\Ai;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class AiController extends Controller
{
    public function chat(Request $request)
    {
        $response = Ai::quick($request->input('message'));
        
        return response()->json([
            'response' => $response->text,
        ]);
    }
    
    public function stream(Request $request)
    {
        $generator = Ai::stream($request->input('message'));
        
        return StreamedAiResponse::fromGenerator($generator);
    }
}
```

### In Commands

```php
namespace App\Console\Commands;

use CreativeCrafts\LaravelAiAssistant\Facades\Ai;
use Illuminate\Console\Command;

class AiChatCommand extends Command
{
    protected $signature = 'ai:chat {message}';
    
    public function handle()
    {
        $response = Ai::quick($this->argument('message'));
        $this->info($response->text);
    }
}
```

### In Jobs

```php
namespace App\Jobs;

use CreativeCrafts\LaravelAiAssistant\Facades\{Ai, Observability};
use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;

class ProcessAiRequest implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Queueable;
    
    public function __construct(
        private string $correlationId,
        private string $prompt
    ) {}
    
    public function handle()
    {
        Observability::setCorrelationId($this->correlationId);
        
        $response = Ai::quick($this->prompt);
        
        // Process response...
    }
}
```

## Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. Error Handling
All examples include proper try-catch blocks and error reporting.

### 2. Resource Cleanup
Memory tracking and cleanup patterns are shown in observability examples.

### 3. Correlation IDs
Observability example shows request tracing across operations.

### 4. Graceful Degradation
Cancellation examples show how to handle timeouts and limits.

### 5. Type Safety
Unified API examples demonstrate strongly-typed interfaces.

## Troubleshooting

### "Class not found" errors

Make sure you've installed the package:
```bash
composer require creativecrafts/laravel-ai-assistant
```

### "API key not configured" errors

Set your OpenAI API key in `.env`:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### "Connection timeout" errors

Check your internet connection and OpenAI API status. Increase timeout in config:
```php
// config/ai-assistant.php
'timeout' => 60, // seconds
```

### Examples not running

These are standalone scripts. For Laravel integration, use controllers, commands, or jobs as shown above.
